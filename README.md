# ELEC0138_data

This repository contains the data that was collected for the Wireshark attack and DNS sinkhole defence.

For the .pcap files, all tests were done with all data collection settings opted in on the TV. This includes the following:
- Limit AD tracking
- Live plus (Settings basically admits this is ACR) - buried in additional settings
- Screen saver promotion
- Home promotion (Ads on home screen)
- AI recommendation: content recommendation and network-based recommendation

In addition to the Pi-hole blocklist file found here, these blocklists were also used:
